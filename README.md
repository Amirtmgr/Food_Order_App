## Overview
The **Little Lemon Food Ordering UI/UX Design** is a conceptual prototype for a food ordering platform inspired by a restaurant called "Little Lemon" in Chicago. While this is not a functional app, it showcases key UI/UX design concepts and interactions.

   - Simple icons, legible fonts, and ample white space contribute to a visually appealing experience.

2. **User Flow**:
   - The prototype demonstrates the user journey, from browsing the menu to placing an order.
   - Consideration was given to intuitive navigation and logical steps.

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - High-priority elements (e.g., menu items, order summary) are prominently displayed.
   - Color contrast and font size guide users' attention.
